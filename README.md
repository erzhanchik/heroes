>1. Create an arbitrary form with bootstrap and vue.js, say, a contact or order form with at least five fields of different types: text, drop-down, date, radio, check box. 
>2. Add validation to the form fields. 
>3. Send a JSON-object with filled-in data to a REST-service on the submission: { fieldId1: 'value1', fieldId2: 'value2', ... } 
>4. Implement the REST-service using C# and ASP.NET Web Api that retrieves, saves, and returns data (JSON-objects) of forms. 
>5. Create a page for listing and searching the submitted objects. 
>6. Pack all JS- and CSS-files of the project into a single file and minify it with the help of Webpack.
